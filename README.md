# Professional ReadMe Generator
![License: Apache](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

## Description
This application allows users to generate a professional readme file with all necessary information including a functioning Table of Contents, section for a video tutorial, and a working link to their GitHub and email.

My motivation for this application was an easy way to create a ReadMe file from the terminal. Every project has a Readme File, so with this application, users will spend less time trying to write the perfect ReadMe, and more time focusing on the project they are trying to cpmplete. This will save time and increase productivity.
