# Professional ReadMe Generator

## Description
- This application allows users to create a professional readme with ease. Once installed, the user runs this application in their terminal and it will ask them a series of questions for the readme file. Once they have answered all the questions, a readme file will automatically generate in a professional format with all the information needed.
-My motivation for creating this application was a quick and easy way to generate readme files. Every project will always contain a readme file, so when using this application, that saves me time and gives more time to work on the actual project I would like to work on.
