# E-Commerce Back End
![License: Apache](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

## Description
This application allows users to manage information for a back end e-commerce website. This application uses the latest technologies such as Express.js API, MySQL, and Sequelize.

My motivation for building this application was to make an easy way for companies to manage their back end website to compete with other e-commerce websites.
